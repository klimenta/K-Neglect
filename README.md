Simple daily reminder

You have 3 reminders. Type a description, schedule a time and check to enable.
Don't schedule more than 24 hrs in advance.
Seconds are ignored. Minimum interval is 1 minute.
You can choose a date, but the program doesn't check the dates.
If you want to schedule something for tomorrow, schedule the time past.
E.g. If it's 3PM and you want scheduled something for tomorrow 8AM,
schedule the reminder for 8AM and leave the program running in the tray.
